<p>This is an invitation to take part in a research study on the behavioural changes affecting our daily lives in relation to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. To decide if you wish to take part, please read the following information carefully.</p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of this study?</b></p>
<p>This study is looking at how people react to the changes in their daily routines and behaviours due to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). We particularly focus on the social, cognitive and cultural factors influencing people’s involvement with the practice of keeping physical distance from others. We will examine how people’s reactions to this practice change over time and across cultures.</p>
<p><b>What will happen if I agree to take part?</b></p>
<p>You will answer some questions about your experience of the coronavirus outbreak and the practice of keeping physical distance from others. Some questions will ask about how vulnerable you feel to contracting coronavirus and whether a loved one has had it. We will also ask about your social interactions, mood and well-being. In order to be able to track how people’s responses change over time, we ask that you fill out the survey at 6 time points that are two weeks apart from each other. The first survey is the longest and will take about 10 minutes to complete. The other surveys will be about half as long.</p>
<p>Please note that you need to complete the survey in a single go, but you can take breaks in-between – if you leave the survey and wish to continue later, you will need to fill it out from the beginning. We will send you reminder emails for the follow-up surveys.</p>
<p><b>Are there any risks or benefits of participating in this study?</b></p>
<p>We do not anticipate participation to have any negative consequences beyond the risks encountered in normal life or whilst reading about COVID-19 on the internet or the news. You may find some of the questions about the coronavirus outbreak distressing or upsetting. At any sign of discomfort at any point, you are free to stop without providing any reason (see next question).</p>
<p>Should you need assistance about the coronavirus disease and/or any mental health issues, please refer to the World Health Organization’s advice on <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/mental-health-considerations.pdf?sfvrsn=6d3578af_2" target="_blank">mental health</a>.
<p>Participation has no immediate personal benefits to you, but you will help scientists better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting people’s lives.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to take part?</b></p>
<p>Participation in this study is totally voluntary and you are under no obligation to take part. If you are finding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to be very stressful and causing anxiety or distress, you may not wish to participate in this survey. You may also skip some of the questions by choosing the “prefer not to answer” option.</p>
<p>You are free to withdraw at any point before or during the study. If you wish to withdraw after having started a survey, close your browser window and all your data will be deleted automatically. If you wish not to participate in future time points, simply do not complete those surveys. If you wish to withdraw your responses from a previous time point(s), please email us with your login ID within 2 weeks of filling out that survey.</p>
<p><b>What happens to the results of the research study?</b></p>
<p>The findings will be presented in scientific conferences and publications and are intended to inform policy decisions. All reports will include findings only from group-level analyses. You will not be identifiable in any ensuing reports or publications. We will store all data in password-protected university repositories in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). You may contact the University of Nottingham’s data protection officer on details about your rights towards your data at: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utilities/privacy/privacy.aspx. As an online participant in this research, we are obliged to make you aware that although we have taken all measures to keep you data strictly confidential, there is always a potential risk of intrusion by outside agents, for example through hacking, and therefore the possibility of being identified.</p>
<p><b>What should I do next?</b></p>
<p>If you agree to take part, please press the “Proceed to the study” button below and fill out the consent form. If you have any questions or concerns please don’t hesitate to ask now. We can also be contacted after your participation at the above address.</p>
