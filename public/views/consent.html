<p>This is an invitation to take part in a research study on the behavioural changes affecting our daily lives in relation to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. To decide if you wish to take part, please read the following information carefully.</p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of this study?</b></p>
<p>This study is looking at how people react to the changes in their daily routines and behaviours due to the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). We particularly focus on the social, cognitive and cultural factors influencing people’s involvement with the practice of keep physical distance from others. We will examine how people’s reactions to this practice change over time and across cultures.</p>
<p><b>What will happen if I agree to take part?</b></p>
<p>If you participate, we will ask you to answer some questions about what you think about the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken by yourself and those around you. In order to be able to track change in people’s reactions over time, we ask that you fill out the survey at 6 time points: today, one week later, two weeks later, a month later, two months later and three months later.</p>
<p>At each time point, the survey will take around 15 minutes to complete. Please note that you need to complete the survey in a single go – if you leave the survey and wish to continue later, you will need to fill it out from the beginning. We will send you reminder emails for the follow-up surveys.</p>
<p><b>Are there any risks of participating in this study?</b></p>
<p>We do not anticipate participation to have any negative consequences beyond the risks encountered in normal life. You may find some of the questions about the coronavirus outbreak distressing or upsetting. At any sign of discomfort at any point, you are free to stop without providing any reason (see next question).</p>
<p><b>Do I have to take part?</b></p>

<p>If you wish to withdraw after having started a survey, close your browser window and all your data will be deleted automatically. If you wish not to participate in future time points, simply do not log in to the survey for those time points that you wish not to complete. If you wish to withdraw your responses from a previous time point(s), please email us with your login ID and we will delete your data from all records. </p>
